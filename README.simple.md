# Polkadot UI Template

A minimal Vite + React template pre-wired with Polkadot extension integration.


Prerequisites
- Node 18+

Package manager
- This workspace may prefer pnpm (check your global setup). The project supports Yarn as well but the environment where I installed was configured for pnpm.

Quick start (pnpm)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd polkadot-ui-template
pnpm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Quick start (yarn)

```bash
cd polkadot-ui-template
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and use the Connect Wallet page to request accounts from the Polkadot{.js} browser extension.
